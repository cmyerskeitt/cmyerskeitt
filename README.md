👋 Hi, I’m Christine Myers Keitt! 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer utilizing Javascript and Ruby on Rails to create some really awesome projects. 

As an educator turned software engineer, I embody a natural curiosity for learning. I am super excited about the endless amount of learning ahead of me.

This past year, I managed to complete my software engineering bootcamp part-time while teaching during a pandemic and being a wife and mom to a small child. I say all this to say that I have great planning and time management skills that increase my ability to create efficient code.

As I transition out of the classroom into the tech world, I'm most excited to bring many of my teaching skills with me. I think my teaching experience will make me exceptionally great at being able to verbalize and communicate the thought process behind web applications.
