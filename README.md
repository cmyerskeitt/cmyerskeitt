👋 Hi, I’m Christine Myers Keitt! 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer utilizing Javascript and Ruby on Rails to create some really awesome projects. 

This past year, I managed to complete my software engineering bootcamp part-time while teaching during a pandemic and being a mom to a small child. I say all this to say that I have great planning and time management skills that increase my ability to create efficient code.

As an educator turned software engineer, I embody a natural curiosity for learning. I am super excited about the endless amount of learning ahead of me.

Currently Learning: <br>
  ◆ StackSkills: 2021 Complete Ruby on Rails 6 Bootcamp
  <br>
  ◆ Algoexperts: Data Structures and Algorithms 
  <br>
  ◆ A Common Sense Guide to Data Structuresand Algorithms: Level Up Your Core programming Skills by Jay Wengrow
  <br>

What a great journey this has been so far and I'm just now getting started.
